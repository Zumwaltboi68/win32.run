# Introduction

Yet another Windows XP in the browser, but with a File System and comes with it, Programs.

_Microsoft and Windows XP trademarks & logos definitely belong to Microsoft Corporation. All the programs' names and logos (Foxit, Word, WinRar, Internet Explorer, etc.) are of their rightful copyright holders._ _**win32.run**_ _is purely for the purpose of nostalgia. I have no intent and no right to monetize_ _**win32.run**__, but you may occasionally see ads when playing third-party games._

win32.run runs purely on the client-side (the user's browser). All files are processed right in the user's browser. There is no file uploading, no server-side processing (cause I'm broke, can't afford it). Each user has his own OS session (just like the good old Windows XP)

Files (and Folders) in win32.run are stored locally in IndexedDB. Apps (and 3rd-party apps) can interact with files through win32.run homemade file picker and saver dialog (with Windows XP appearance).
